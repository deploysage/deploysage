  # We've added an action called "preflight" that renders nothing. OPTIONS is an HTTP method.
  # When making a cross origin request, the HTTP client will automatically make an additional
  # request called a "preflight check" before the actual request you are expecting it to make.
  # The preflight check uses the OPTIONS request method, basically just to ask the server for a
  # green light to make subsequent cross origin requests, and it doesn't actually require a
  # response body, just the headers to tell it what's allowed.
