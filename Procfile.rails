# Basic procfile for dev work using Rails
# Development rails requires both rails and rails-assets
# (and rails-server-assets if server rendering)
# You can still run tests, and they will build the webpack file for each test run.
# Start another shell and run the Procfile.spec to make test runs faster.

rails: PORT=3000 rails s
# Run the hot reload server for client development
rails-assets: sh -c 'rm -f app/assets/webpack/* && HOT_RAILS_PORT=3500 npm run build:dev:client'
# Keep the JS fresh for server rendering. Remove if not server rendering
rails-server-assets: sh -c 'npm run build:dev:server'
